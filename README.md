# rQuery Builder (WIP)

**rQuery Builder** is a lightweight, modular SQL query builder designed to generate SQL statements dynamically and programmatically. It aims to simplify common query construction across various databases‚Äîwithout the heavy abstraction of traditional ORMs.

Unlike most ORMs, `rQuery Builder` respects the syntax and features unique to each supported database. It provides isolated modules and methods per database, ensuring full flexibility and alignment with native SQL dialects.

## üõ† Development Setup

To speed up builds, it's recommended to use [`sccache`](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache) for caching compiled dependencies.

### Installing `sccache`

#### Linux / macOS (via Cargo):
```bash
cargo install sccache
```

#### macOS (via Homebrew):
```bash
brew install sccache
```

#### Windows (via Chocolatey):
```powershell
choco install sccache
```

### Configure Cargo to Use `sccache`

Add the following to your `.cargo/config.toml`:

```toml
[build]
rustc-wrapper = "sccache"
```

Verify it's working:
```bash
sccache --show-stats
```
